# WebLaunch #

WebLaunch is an extension for the Kindle Touch ( and probably the Kindle PaperWhite too ) with JailBreak and the application launcher KUAL. It is designed to open a URL without the browser frame (the black status bar can be removed too) to make it look like a native application.

## Installation ##

* Make sure your Kindle Touch is already Jailbreaked
* Make sure you have KUAL installed and the "extensions" folder exists 
* Copy the WebLaunch folder to the "extensions" folder ( don't rename it without changing bin/start.sh first )
* Copy the settings.example.js in the WebLaunch folder to settings.js and change its contents to fit your needs

## Background ##

WebLaunch is based on "mesquite" former WAF and utilizes the "Kindle" template library and a few system librarys based on it to bring as much native browser behaviour as possible.

## Notes ##

Special thanks go to the folks at mobileread.com for their great work opening up the Kindle.
